// Include any default variable overrides here (though functions won't be available)

@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";

/* 
 
  The steps will be:
    1. Install Bootstrap
    2. Install sass
    3. Import Bootstrap into your main.scss file
    4. Customize Bootstrap's styling
    5. Compile your main.scss file into a main.css file
    6. Link your main.css file to your HTML file

  This will import all of Bootstrap's styles, but it will also allow you to override them with your own custom styles.
    
    You can also import individual components from Bootstrap, like so:
    @import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions";
    @import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";
    @import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/mixins";

    Note: This allows you not to have to import the entire Bootstrap library, but only the parts you need.
