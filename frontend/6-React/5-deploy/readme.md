## Deployment

Deployment is the process of making an application or system available for use in a specific environment, 
such as production, staging, or development. 

The deployment process involves various stages, from preparing the application to be deployed, 
transferring it to the target environment, configuring the environment, 
and finally making it available to end-users. 

Effective deployment ensures that the application runs efficiently, securely, and with minimal downtime.

### Key Steps in the Deployment Process

**Build:** Create a production build using your chosen build tool. 
This process typically involves running a command that optimizes your app for performance by minifying 
JavaScript files, optimizing images, and removing unnecessary.

**Output:** The output is usually a folder (often named dist or build) containing static files.

For Vite, it would involve running `vite build` to generate the production build.
```bash
vite build
```

To test it locally, you can use `vite preview` to serve the production build.
```bash 
vite preview
```

**Deploy:** Transfer the production build to the target environment.
This could involve copying the files to a web server, cloud storage, or a content delivery network (CDN).

Static sites can be deployed to services like Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or AWS S3.                                                                                     
Traditional web servers like Apache or Nginx can also be used to serve static files.

**Upload:** Use the platform's UI, CLI, or integrate with a Git repository to deploy the build folder.

**Configure:** Set up any necessary configurations, such as environment variables, routing rules, or security settings.

For a Single Page Application (SPA), you may need to configure server-side routing to handle client-side routing.
